@* CascadingValue is used to pass a value down the component tree to all descendant components. *@
@* In a real application I would use CascadingAuthenticationState instead of this component. *@

<CascadingValue Value="@_user" IsFixed="true">
    @ChildContent
</CascadingValue>

@code {
    [Parameter]
    public RenderFragment? ChildContent { get; set; }

    // Simulates a user object with a PlayerId, which could be an authenticated user
    private UserDto _user = new UserDto { PlayerId = 1 };
}
